- Download NIH ChestX-ray 14 dataset. 
- Simply extract all images from folders `images_001` - `images_012`, and put them into `all_classes` folder. (Since I do not want to split the dataset )

The directory should be organized as follows:
```
      NIH_ChestX-ray/
            all_classes/
                  xxxx1.png
                  xxxx2.png
                  ...
                  xxxxn.png
            master/
                  train_1.txt
                  trian_10.txt
                  train_list.txt
                  val_list.txt
                  test_list.txt
```
